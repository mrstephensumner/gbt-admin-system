# Specification Quality Checklist: Admin Roles & Operator Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation run 2026-07-16 against the initial draft: all items pass.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed. Notable defaults recorded in
  Assumptions: Owner + per-operator grants (no custom roles), operator management is
  Owner-only, ownership transfer out of scope, grants control actions not visibility,
  and the sign-in allow-list stays separately maintained.
- "Cloudflare Access" appears only as the named existing authentication gate this
  feature builds on (established in spec 001), not as an implementation choice made here.
